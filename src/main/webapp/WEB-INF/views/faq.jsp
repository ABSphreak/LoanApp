					on loans, then people with fixed rate home loan will not be
					affected by any increase or decrease in the market interest rates
					and the EMI amount will remain unchanged. This type of home loan is
					less popular these days.</div>

				1. Processing Fee- When applying for a loan, a fee is paid to the
				lender known as processing fee. The amount paid could be either a
				percentage of the loan amount or a fixed amount that is paid in lieu
				of carrying out the loan sanction formalities.<br> 2.
				Commitment Fee- It is essential to avail the loan within a
				stipulated time period after it is processed and sanctioned
				otherwise some financial institutions levy a commitment fee. By
				paying the commitment fee, you are assured that you can access the
				loan at the interest rate and for the tenure that was initially
				agreed on. Most banks no longer charge this fee.<br> 3.
				Pre-payment Charges- Banks/ financial institutions might charge a
				penalty if the entire loan amount is paid off before completion of
				the loan tenure. The penalty amount also known as
				foreclosure/pre-payment charges could be a maximum of 5% of the loan
				amount that is paid off before the completion of loan tenure.<br>
				4. Miscellaneous charges- Documentation, stamp duty, credit bureau
				report issuance charges and consultant charges are generally
				considered as miscellaneous charges by few lenders.
